                    <p class="pb-3 border-bottom">The page design <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/examples/blog/">link</a></p>
                    <p>Russian troops launched a broad, three-pronged assault on Ukraine that opened with air and missile strikes on Ukrainian military facilities and included ground troops invading from Crimea.</p>
                    <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 137 "heroes" including 10 military officers had been killed and another 316 wounded. Ukraine’s leadership called it a "full-scale war" targeting the country from the east, north and south.</p>
                    <p>Ukraine said Russia’s intent was to destroy the state of Ukraine, a Western-looking democracy intent on escaping Moscow’s orbit.</p>
                    <p class="border-bottom pb-3">As Ukrainian forces fought back and civilians piled into trains and cars to flee, the U.S. and European leaders rushed to respond, if not directly in Ukraine, with strong financial sanctions to punish Russia. NATO moved to strengthen its eastern flank.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Here are the things to know about the conflict over Ukraine and the security crisis in Eastern Europe:</h3>
                    <h1>PUTIN MAKES HIS MOVE</h1>
                    <p>In a televised address as the attack began, Russian President Vladimir Putin said it was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists have been fighting for almost eight years.</p>
                    <p>The U.S. had predicted Putin would falsely claim that the rebel-held regions were under attack to justify an invasion.</p>
                    <p>The Russian leader warned other countries that any attempt to interfere in Ukraine would "lead to consequences you have never seen in history" — a dark threat implying Russia was prepared to use its nuclear weapons.</p>
                    
                    <p>Putin accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia’s demands to block Ukraine from ever joining NATO and offer Moscow security guarantees.</p>
                    <p>Putin said Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but plans to "demilitarize" it. He urged Ukrainian servicemen to "immediately put down arms and go home." Soon after his address, explosions were heard in the cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa.</p>
                    <p>Hours later the Russian Defense Ministry confirmed that its ground forces had moved into Ukraine from Crimea, saying they advanced toward the city of Kherson to the northwest.    </p>
                    <p>The ministry said it has destroyed 83 Ukrainian military facilities.</p>
                    <p>Ukraine’s leadership said Ukraine lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site, where Ukrainian forces waged a fierce battle with Russian troops. A nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, exploded in April 1986.</p>
                    
                    <h1>CHERNOBYL IN RUSSIAN HANDS</h1>
                    <p>Ukraine said it lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site after Ukrainian forces waged a fierce battle with Russian troops. A nuclear reactor at the plant 130 kilometers (80 miles) north of Kyiv exploded in April 1986, sending a radioactive cloud across Europe. The damaged reactor was later covered by a protective shell.</p>
                    <p>Alyona Shevtsova, an adviser to the commander of Ukraine’s Ground Forces, wrote on Facebook that the staff had been "taken hostage" when Russian troops seized the facility. The White House press secretary expressed alarm, concerned that it could hamper efforts to maintain the nuclear facility.</p>
