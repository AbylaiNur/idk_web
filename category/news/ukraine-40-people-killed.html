                    <p>KYIV, Ukraine - An adviser to Ukraine’s president says about 40 people have been killed so far in the Russian attack on the country.</p>
                    <p>Oleksii Arestovich, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that several dozen people have been wounded.</p>
                    <p>He didn’t specify whether the casualties included civilians.</p>
                    <p>Zelenskyy said the Ukrainian authorities will hand weapons to all those willing to defend the country.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3 border-bottom">"The future of the Ukrainian people depends on every Ukrainian," he said, urging all those who can defend the country to come to the Interior Ministry’s assembly facilities.</p>
                    <p>KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s president says his country has cut diplomatic ties with Russia after it was attacked.</p> 
                    <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the decision to rupture ties with Moscow on Thursday after it launched a massive air and missile attack on its neighbor and Russian forces were seen rolling into Ukraine.</p>
                    <p class="pb-3 border-bottom">Ukrainian officials say the country’s military is fighting back and asked for Western defense assistance.</p>
                    <p>KYIV, Ukraine — A Ukrainian presidential adviser says that Russian forces have launched an attack on Ukraine from the north, east and south. The adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said "the Ukrainian military is fighting hard."</p>
                    <p>Podolyak said Thursday that "our army is fighting back inflicting significant losses to the enemy." He said that there have been civilian casualties, but didn’t give details.</p>
                    <p>He said that "Ukraine now needs a greater and very specific support from the world — military-technical, financial as well as tough sanctions against Russia," he said.</p>
                    <p>Another adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia has targeted air bases and various other military infrastructure.</p>
                    <p>Oleksii Arestovich said the Russian strike hasn’t achieved its goal to rout the country’s military. He said that "we suffered casualties, but they aren’t significant," adding that the Russian strikes "haven’t eroded the combat capability of the Ukrainian military."</p>
                    <p>He said that the Russian troops moved up to 5 kilometers (about 3 miles) deep into the Ukrainian territory in the Kharkiv and Chernihiv regions, and, possibly in other areas.</p>
