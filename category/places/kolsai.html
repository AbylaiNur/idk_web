                    <p>From the Kazakh language, the single name "Kolsai" can be translated as "lake in the gorge", because all reservoirs belong to the natural depression of the same name. Kolsai lakes are located on the territory of the national park "Kolsai Kolderi" in the Almaty region.</p>
                    <p class="border-bottom pb-4 mb-4">They are called the "blue necklace" for the amazingly clear water, on the surface of which the endless blue sky is reflected. The system of Kolsai reservoirs includes three lakes: Upper, Middle and Lower - all of them are quite deep, cool and very, very beautiful. Trekking routes, horse riding excursions and walks are organized here.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-3 text-secondary">How to get there?</h4>
                    <p>From Almaty, you have to overcome 285 km to the village of Saty and about 10 more to the first Kolsai lake. All the way on asphalt - where it is better, where it is worse. After passing the village of Saty, at the fork, you need to go up and to the left along the main road. At the next fork, go straight - to the ecological post of the national park "Kolsai Kolderi". You will reach the first lake by car, where there is a modern parking lot, and further, depending on the degree of physical fitness and available time, you can walk up to the second and third lakes. The lakes are located at an altitude of 1700 m, 2250 m and 2700 meters above sea level.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3 text-secondary">Meals and accommodation</h4>
                    <p>In the village of Saty, you can stay in comfortable and authentic guest houses, try national dishes prepared by the owners of the houses, and enjoy the unhurried life of the Kazakh village. Accommodation is best booked in advance through travel companies. During the warm season, without agreement, all houses can be occupied. Meals are usually included in the accommodation of the place where you stay, there are no separate cafes here.</p>
                    <p>You can also stay in hotels directly near the first Kolsai lake. And you can equip a tent camp. Then it is better to stock up on groceries in Almaty.</p>
                    <h4 class="mb-3 text-secondary">Advice for foreign guests</h4>
                    <p>Despite the fact that the Kolsai Lakes and Lake Kaiyndy are located in the border area, which is part of the border zone, no passes are required to visit them, since the lakes are on the list of territories where certain regime restrictions are excluded or suspended.</p>
